- project: Drug Discovery for Breast Cancer - IBM-QueryBoX
  role: Idea Owner & Team Lead
  duration: Dec 2023
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul><li>Breast cancer remains a significant health concern, necessitating advanced drug discovery efforts. This paper presents a comprehensive approach, including target identification, lead discovery, optimization, preclinical testing, clinical trials, and regulatory approval. <li>We focus on the role of aromatase and the significance of pIC50 values in drug discovery. The data gathering process involves two organisms, Homo sapiens and Rattus norvegicus, with a dataset from the ChEMBL database. Additionally, Lipinski descriptors and PaDEL-descriptor are employed for evaluating drug likeness. Our research culminates in the development of regression models for predicting pIC50 values, enhancing drug discovery efficiency.<ul/>

- project: Vision Based Alert System for Drivers
  role: Primary Developer and Idea Owner
  duration: January 2019
  # url: "#"
  description:  <ul><li> A Application which will provide Alerts to users based on vehical speed and Traffic Signs on road. <li>we Introduced A Proto-Type using Raspberrypi and OpenCv. In this project we developed a Neural Network which can detect most of the indian road signs with 90% Accuracy and we integrated it with a GPS based speed recognition mechanism to alert the users based on road sign and car speed.<ul>
