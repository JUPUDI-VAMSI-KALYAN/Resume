- project: Drug Discovery for Breast Cancer
  role: Idea Owner & Primary Developer
  duration: Dec 2023 
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul><li>Breast cancer remains a significant health concern, necessitating advanced drug discovery efforts. This paper presents a comprehensive approach, including target identification, lead discovery, optimization, preclinical testing, clinical trials, and regulatory approval. <li>We focus on the role of aromatase and the significance of pIC50 values in drug discovery. The data gathering process involves two organisms, Homo sapiens and Rattus norvegicus, with a dataset from the ChEMBL database. Additionally, Lipinski descriptors and PaDEL-descriptor are employed for evaluating drug likeness. Our research culminates in the development of regression models for predicting pIC50 values, enhancing drug discovery efficiency.<ul/>

- project: NuroInsight - A Deep Learning Approach to Precise Classification of Brain Tumor
  role: Primary Developer
  duration: Nov 2023 
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul><li>NuroInsight, a machine learning framework for predictive brain tumor classification. Leveraging a diverse dataset encompassing Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and normal brain images, sourced from the Brain Tumors 256x256 dataset on Kaggle, the framework employs a systematic pipeline comprising data gathering, pre-processing, model training, and deployment. Utilizing various neural network architectures, including custom models, VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, each tailored to discern specific tumor features, the study achieves noteworthy results. Particularly, the VGG16 model demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing tumor and non-tumor brain images. <li>The deployment phase marks a crucial step towards practical applications, holding potential for early detection and treatment. Overall, NuroInsight underscores the significance of machine learning in medical imaging, showcasing promising outcomes in brain tumor classification through advanced neural network architectures.<ul/>

  description: <ul><li>Built a Expert Recommendation system as an improvement for existing Query resolution platform as part of IBM Hackathon 2022 with a team of 6 IBMerâ€™s <li>We Developed a MVP of Real time Hybrid Expert Recommendation system using TOP-N Recommendation Approach based on users skills and Users context.This will provide a platform for subject Matter experts and Developers to connect in IBM.<ul/>


# Springfield Community Outreach Group
- project: Vision Based Alert System for Drivers
  role: Primary Developer and Idea Owner
  duration: January 2019
  # url: "#"
  description:  <ul><li> A Application which will provide Alerts to users based on vehical speed and Traffic Signs on road. <li>we Introduced A Proto-Type using Raspberrypi and OpenCv. In this project we developed a Neural Network which can detect most of the indian road signs with 90% Accuracy and we integrated it with a GPS based speed recognition mechanism to alert the users based on road sign and car speed.<ul>
